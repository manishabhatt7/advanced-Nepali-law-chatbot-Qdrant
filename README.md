# advanced-Nepali-law-chatbot-Qdrant
This project aims to make the Constitution of Nepal more accessible through an intuitive RAG chatbot. By combining powerful LLMs (OpenAI), vector search (Qdrant), and intelligent text processing (LangChain), it allows anyone to ask questions and get direct, context-aware answers from the official document.
